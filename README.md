# Computer-Architecture

Program is coded based on:


Problem: Given a number in hexadecimal format that represents a MIPS instruction, identify the following:

a. The format of the instruction (eg R-Format/I-Format)
b. Operation (e.g. add,sub,and,or,ect.)
c. The source register number/s (in decimal, sepparated by comma if two operands exist)
d. The destination register number (in decimal)
e. Shift amount (in decimal)
f. Constant / offset (in decimal) 

If a field does not exist for a given input, print "none" for that field. You may only consider the 
add,addi,sub,and,or,slt,lw,sw, and beq instructions of the MIPS architecture.
